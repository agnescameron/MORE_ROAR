/* DIALOGUES

SOUND ACTIVISM
‘Art and technology’ isn’t a neutral space - it’s as much the domain of huge multinational companies, many of them with direct links to the military - as it is a space of resistance to those same structures. Too often these ideas collapse onto one another, ‘sponsored by Google Arts and Culture’, ‘Aviation and Defence Applications’. If all technology is military technology, why doesn’t Palestine Action smash this synth? It’s a genuine question. In the first chapter of The Undercommons, Fred Moten and Stefano Harney state that “the false image is what emerges when a critique of militarised life is predicated on the forgetting of the life that surrounds it.”

Much contemporary technological development, ‘progress’ is concerned with making things that ‘appear’ to be alive but are not. What is real technical liveness? Sounds are there to live in social space, to be carried around and shared and transferred.

How can we use this technology that is out of war, for war? Perhaps there is some small resistance to it all, a form of subversion of the technology by making noise.

What's in a sound? Chinese musician and artist Yan Jun has run an experimental music event series in Beijing for years. It's 2015, and I've arrived in Beijing to perform at the series. But the night before the performance, I got a message saying the venue for the event had been forced to close. A video had been played there as part of another event and the authorities deemed it critical of the State. My performance was to be moved to a hairdresser’s salon in a hutong! Given the national and international range of artists, I asked Yan “Why haven’t the authorities shut down your series after all this time?” He replied “What's in a sound? What's in a sound John?”

I live in Leicester. Just outside the city is a village with a street named Ned Ludd Close. Ned Ludd, from whom the Luddites take their name, is purported to have come from around these parts. I’ve always been drawn to the Luddites and how they've been misrepresented throughout history as technophobes or anti-progress when in fact they were only trying to protect their livelihoods and place in society. Casualties of technological progress.

GITHUB AS FORM OF PUBLISHING
What’s made needs to be shared, to be reproducible and reworkable. Text files are funny things - they’re so abstract, but they can move anywhere. I like having a folder of these things online - symbols and code - that can be ‘rehydrated’ into a living thing. It’s not perfect, nothing is, but it’s nice to see the trail of ideas, where they came from, to recompose.

GitHub is generally thought of as a place to publish and share code. Why not also include ideas and thoughts, prose and manifestos? This text is ‘published’ as a header file for the MORE ROAR! code. Macro-comments!

DO YOU IDENTIFY AS AN ARTIST OR MUSICIAN AGNES?
Art and music both give you different lenses of looking at the world, so does engineering, physics, etc. A lot of the work I do is really concerned with the material nature of things. I like the feeling of acquiring a new language to describe something, to express it to different people in different ways.

For so many years my main language for describing electronics was circuit diagrams and maths, and I love it. I think these tools are amazingly useful, but there’s so much work you need to do to use them expressively. It’s not impossible. I think Horowitz and Hill really meant it when they called their book The Art of Electronics - but it’s hard to understand such a book unless you’re really good at maths. You end up having a particular kind of interaction that’s very opinionated about what’s the ‘right’ way of doing things. So, everyone can’t just get it! I think music is a really immediate way of giving expressive form to electronics, it feels natural and very ‘alive’.

Maybe at heart I identify as a technician, in that I’m very concerned with understanding how things work, and in communicating that understanding. I’m not interested in technology that’s closed off to people. I think art and music are really powerful ways of getting to an expressive language for technology that’s more widely accessible.

ON COLLABORATION
Workshops are a critical part of my practice that operate on lots of levels: a hands-on activity; and a space to search and reflect. They also provide a pool of ideas through collaborative design. I may bring along a predetermined circuit or device, but through workshopping, the circuit evolves. Participants become co-collaborators. Ideas are shared. Designs are modified and refined.

I was recently asked to elaborate on the design process used in workshops. I do use calls, “build a DIY noise synth” blah, blah, blah, but I like provocations which are sometimes speculative, for example, “build a DIY noise synth out of thin air”. A short, intensive time span, hackathon-style is often used. Rapid prototyping of sorts. MORE ROAR! has grown out of a series of workshops.

Bringing technical objects into conversation with other people always changes them [people or object?]. There’s always some form of translation required and that feeds back into the objects themselves.

CODING APPROACH
I’m currently writing in this document instead of writing code because the IDE is broken again! This project depends on a very fragile and large mountain of software, which both allows for complicated things to happen, but also makes revisiting and reopening the project really taxing. I think because of that, the project has been coded in fits and starts - a week here, a day there. Once it’s working, there’s this rush to make changes while you can still remember what’s going on!

Similarly, adding stuff can be really painful. Days and days staring at documentation, and in the end it’s just one or two lines of code. Sometimes I feel like I don’t do very many technically hard things these days. This is an antidote, you really have to do it yourself. There’s something so satisfying about that!

Hours spent getting no sound. I sometimes get to the stage where I kind of give up thinking logically, whatever that means, and just throw random numbers or strings of thoughts at a problem. I suppose there’s a process of deduction or trial and error at play, but praying on luck isn’t the most efficient way of working. Coding can lead me to feel desperate and hopeless. Not good for the health! Of course, getting it to work can be euphoric. Why does coding, that is written in text, often feel like chiselling something out of granite!

On the other hand, I’ve recently been getting up in the morning and writing just one coding task down on a piece of paper and rigorously trying to complete this task.

Is there such a thing as naive engineering? You can build a house upon sand.

WHY ENTROPIC?
inside-transformation (Greek)

en = inside
trope = transformation

Paradoxically, we wanted to create something that very much felt alive. But you can’t have one without the other, life without death so to say. The ultimate goal of life is death etc. (Schopenhauer). Maybe it’s our predisposition towards a death drive, self-destruction. A return to an inorganic state.

Something fluid, in flux and therefore precious.

Electronically generated sound as being more ephemeral.

Sound that must be found, ‘wayfared’, discovered and lost again.

The celebration of surprise. Only when we are certain of the outcome does entropy vanish (Shannon).

Well, we have generative art or sound, which MORE ROAR! is. It is a generative sound artwork. But its entropic nature (behaviour) is degenerative: waveforms and resulting sounds erode, decay, deconstruct, and diminish; or move from pitch to noise, order to disorder. It’s predominantly about becoming less.

I think it’s nice to be able to hear something change. It gets at the algorithm level we’re using, this rotting waveform being crunched out of the chip.

The chip itself is entropic. It won’t last forever. There’s transistor aging. It will eventually cease working. If I print the code on a piece of paper, this will probably outlive the code on the chip!

CRITICAL SOUND SYNTHESIS
There’s a reductionist approach to sound-making. This can also be seen as critiquing things like consumer culture, feature creep, information overload, excess and waste, waste at a material and resource level. Themes of technological- and self-determinism are there too.

Dirty Electronics has always been a form, or precursor of critical making. At the turn of the Millenium, I got disillusioned making sound on my own with computers. It felt socially bankrupt and very lonely. I could sense the trappings of proprietary software and hardware, never-ending updates, and draining screen-time. I didn’t wholly accept a digital hegemony and the implications of this. I also missed the engagement with things that made sound, sound-making materials and sound-making people.

It's about how we ‘do’ the sound, ‘musicking’ (Small).

MORE ROAR! explores technology to ask deeper questions about our sound-making and more generally the role of technology within our cultural sphere. It’s a logical step to think of it as a form of ‘critical sound synthesis’ borrowing from critical making (Ratto and Hertz) and critical design, design that isn’t necessarily efficient, optimised, or comfortable (Dunne).

IDIO-SYNTHESIS
I’ve also been thinking about ‘idio-synthesis’, for example, digital sound synthesis at a material-like level that focuses on the idiosyncrasies and limits of a specific chip. But how low can you go? Working with these chips involves a chain of tools, a complex ecosystem. What part of this chain can be explored or exploited to lead to a unique sound? Openchip and similar organisations aim to make chip fabrication and development open source. The answer is lower!

“The idea of ‘rawness’ is suggestive. We can think of raw materials but also raw data, raw meat and raw electricity which encourage us to think of aesthetically brutal approaches, respectively … In [some English dialects], raw is pronounced identically to ‘roar’ - and we can imagine some of the things we make as extending the call of an animal into non-animal, mineral, and electro-magnetic ontologies.” (Bowers et al)
